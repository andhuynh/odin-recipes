        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is taken from the following:</p>
        <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/chicken-katsu-9840942"> Original Food Network Recipe</a>

        <p>Katsu is one of my favorite dishes to eat. 
            The crunchiness of the bread coating combined with the juiciness
            of the meat is the best treat to eat over a bowl of piping hot rice
            and some shredded cabbage for that extra crunch. A side of tonkatsu sauce
            adds that extra sweetness and tanginess the meat needs to balace out the flavors.
